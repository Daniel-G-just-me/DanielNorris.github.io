## Projects

### Self-Hosted DNS and Home Assistant
**Description**: Using a Raspberry Pi with Home Assistant OS installed, I configured Home Assistant to control my smart lights locally. I also set up add-ons to extend its functionality, including integrating ChatGPT for text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT). Additionally, I installed AdGuard as an add-on to enhance internet security by blocking ads and trackers.

### Self-Hosted Webpage
**Description**: Using the same Raspberry Pi with a headless installation and a static IP address, I set up my own webpage using WordPress connected to a database.

### Hack The Box and HackerOne
**Description**: After learning penetration testing in school, I practiced extensively at home using these fantastic platforms to hone my skills.

### HTML and CSS Webpage
**Description**: As part of a school project, I created a small interactive webpage for a hotel booking system.  
**Repository**: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/DanielGNorris/CodePublic/tree/53c1e3b8e19cd884eba65f322762c6f70ae643c2/Sharp%20Shack%20(HTML))

### Penetration Testing Practice at School
**Description**: A cybersecurity company visited our school to teach us basic penetration testing. I practiced these skills using virtual machines, gaining hands-on experience.

### AI Face Detection
**Description**: My first experience with AI involved using a pre-trained model for face detection. I also studied the theoretical foundations of how it works.  
**Repository**: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/DanielGNorris/CodePublic/tree/53c1e3b8e19cd884eba65f322762c6f70ae643c2/Face%20Detection)

### Personal Voice Assistant
**Description**: This personal project taught me how to integrate multiple APIs and libraries to create a functional voice assistant. The assistant uses Googleâ€™s speech recognition and voice detection, and it can perform various functions based on voice commands.  
**Repository**: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/DanielGNorris/CodePublic/blob/53c1e3b8e19cd884eba65f322762c6f70ae643c2/Personal%20Assistant.py)

### BBC Micro:bit Retro Games
**Description**: One of my first projects, this was a fun experiment recreating simple retro games. It was also my introduction to working with graphical elements.
